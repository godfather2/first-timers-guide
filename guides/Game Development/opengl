Opengl is a graphics API(application programming interface) developed and maintained by the Khronos group.It allows us to deal with graphics,to access our GPU.Opengl is just one of the many APIs that can perform this.Other names that come to mind are Direct3D,Vulkan,Metal etc.
One of the many misconceptions about Opengl is that it is a library,or a framework.It is neither.Opengl is basically a specification.It doesn't define any code as such.Also,you can't download Opengl.Your GPU manufacturer implements it.This implies that what works on one GPU don't necessarily work on the others.Another misunderstanding is that Opengl is open-source.It certainly is not.You can't really see the source code behind it.
An important aspect of Opengl is that it is cross platform.Meaning the same code will work on Windows,Linux.This doesn't suggest its supriority over the other APIs mentioned above.Obviously,the apis which are OS specific(for instance Direct3D for Windows and Metal native to Apple) tend to perform better than those that are cross platform.
Within Opengl,there is a distinction between legacy and modern Opengl.Reason,it was very different when it was released in the 90s compared to what it is now.Back then, GPUs weren't as programmable.The code in legacy tend to be shorter.But of course,this is at the expense of your control over it.The biggest distinction between modern and legacy Opengl are shaders.A shader is nothing but a program that runs on your GPU.
